  ## Description
  This project allows the user to read, modify and update a database for an e-commerce website

  ## Installation
  Run npm install in the project directory to install the required packages.

  ## Usage
  To use, first the user must update the .env file with their credentials, then create the database in MySQL. Once the database exists, the user must seed the database with "node seeds/index.js". To begin testing the routes in Insomnia, the user must type "node server.js" to start the server. Once the server has been started, the user can use Insomnia to manipulate the database.
